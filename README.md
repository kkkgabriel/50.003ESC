**First download**

1. Download Node.js and npm (npm comes together with node)
For non ubuntu users, go to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and follow their instructions.
For ubuntu users, use this in your terminal: <br>
`curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_13.x | sudo -E bash -` <br>
`sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`	

	You can verify if you have successfully installed node and npm, or if you already have them with these lines: <br>
`node -v`
	`npm -v`

    
2.  Clone the repo from github, by entering the following line into the terminal. <br>
 `git clone https://github.com/kkkgabriel/50.003ESC.git`
 
3. In your terminal, navigate into the directory and install the packages with: <br>
`npm install`

4. Test the app by deploying the HTTP server locally <br>
`nodemon main`

5. Open your browser and key in: `localhost:3000` in the address bar. If it doesn't work, seek help.
